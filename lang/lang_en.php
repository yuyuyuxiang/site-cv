For example, the contact page does not have a dedicated place in the menu, and is accessible from the "about" menu. The graphic aspect of the website needs to be modernized. Indeed, it has not been changed since the creation of the association nine years ago, while many new themes (modifiable) were born on the CMS. As for the question of responsiveness, the current website was not designed to be consulted from small screens or cell phones. As an illustration, if the menu does not have the necessary space on the screen to unfold, it will simply not be displayed. Finally, because the website is only available in French, it has a smaller reach and will only reach people who speak that language, thus excluding the non-French speaking community that may be interested in the association\'s services.');
